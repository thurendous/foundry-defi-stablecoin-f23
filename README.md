# Stable Coin

1. (Relative Stability) Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
    1. Chainlink price feed
    2. Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
    1. People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
    1. wETH
    2. wBTC: some may argue that this is centralized but it is another conversation
